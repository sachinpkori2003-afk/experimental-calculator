## 📌 Project Overview

The Experimental Calculator is not just a calculator — it is a UI/UX exploration project.  
Each mode intentionally behaves differently to showcase how design, interaction, and logic can change user experience.

This project was built as part of a frontend portfolio to demonstrate:
- Clean UI structuring
- Mode-based behavior handling
- Creative interaction design
- GitHub Pages deployment

## 🧮 Calculator Modes

### ✅ Normal Mode
- Standard arithmetic operations
- Clean, modern UI
- Accurate results

### 🧐 Serious Mode
- Formal, professional interface
- Precision-focused calculations
- Modal-based result presentation

### 🤡 Funny Mode
- Playful UI and animations
- Randomized humor responses
- Intentionally unreliable behavior (for entertainment)

### 😵‍💫 Confusing Mode
- Chaotic interface
- Randomized outputs and system messages
- Designed to simulate instability and errors

> ⚠️ **Note:** Funny and Confusing modes are intentionally inaccurate and exist purely for entertainment and UI experimentation.
